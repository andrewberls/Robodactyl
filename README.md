# Git Resources
I posted a link to the Pro Git book in the dropbox. It gets pretty technical, but the first few pages give a pretty good overview of the basic Git overview. If you're still a little unsure about the whole thing, check out pages 1-20 or so, we won't need anything past that point.

# The Basics
Before we do anything, you'll need to know at least a tiny tiny bit of HTML for the basic setup. HTML is a joke and can be learned in an hour. There are tons of tutorials online, try skimming through the one here: [HTML Basics](http://www.html.net/tutorials/html/lesson2.php) or the various tutorials here: [Mozilla Dev Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn)

# JavaScript Resources
### Codecademy
Free interactive tutorial courses that teach the basics of JavaScript from the very beginning. Very helpful.
[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)  

### Mozilla Developer Network
We'll be doing all of our work using the HTML5 canvas element along with JavaScript. There's a great introduction to canvas and what it's all about here:
[MDN Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial)  
There are tons of other resources on that site as well, I highly recommend it. [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn)

Once you've read over that, the best way to learn is to dive in and try it out. I recommend at least reading through this guy's tutorial, and it can't hurt to actually follow along! 
[Breakout Tutorial](http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/)  
That guy uses jQuery, an extremely popular JavaScript library. We'll probably end up using it for at least a few things, so you can read up on the basics of it here if you want: [Beginner jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery) 


### Eloquent JavaScript
If you find yourself really wanting to learn more about JavaScript, then you can try flipping through the freely available book, [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html). To be honest, it's not very interesting but it's functional at least.
